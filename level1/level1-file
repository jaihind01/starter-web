It’s a simple enough design that has more than a few similarities with the iPhone’s Wallet icon. Compared to the current GPay logo, which consists of two multi-colored and interlocking arcs that are meant to represent wallets, this new icon is much more apparent. It’s arguably not as obvious as a “G” and the word “Pay” side by side, but at least there’s an illustration.
